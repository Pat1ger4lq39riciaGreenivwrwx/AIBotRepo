## AI & Cloud Stack
- **AI/ML:** Graph neural networks (for complex multimodal routing), Reinforcement Learning (for route optimization under dynamic conditions).
- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (Maps Platform, Pub/Sub for real-time data, Cloud Functions for serverless logic, BigQuery for data warehousing).
- **Mobile:** React Native (iOS/Android) for user-facing application.
